# SeriousBot, with a serious readme
A bot written in Python 3.x using a _slightly_ modified version of the [Disco](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco) library.
This bot is mainly just for the servers I like, or that I just add it to.

# Can I contribute?
Sure! Just fork the repo, make your changes and submit a PR. I may or may not look at it :P

# How can I run this myself?
**(NO W I N D O W S Support, kthx)**

I would prefer you didn't, but if you insist on running it yourself here's how:
- Clone the repo
- Type `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal window.
- Profit?!

# What kind of libs does this bot use :thinking:?
Well Mr. Asks too many questions, check out the [requirements.txt file](requirements.txt) for some _requirements_
